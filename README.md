Here are some basic Docker commands to check container health and status:

### 1. **List All Containers**
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```
   - Shows all running and stopped containers, along with their status.

### 2. **Check Logs of a Container**
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_name_or_id>
   ```
   - Displays the logs of a specific container. Use `-f` to follow logs in real-time.

### 3. **Inspect Container Health**
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container_name_or_id>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about the container, including health status if a health check is defined.

### 4. **Check Health Status**
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=<container_name>" --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}"
   ```
   - Filters the output to show the health status of a specific container.

### 5. **Execute a Command Inside a Running Container**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash
   ```
   - Opens an interactive shell inside the container for debugging.

### 6. **Restart a Container**
   ```bash
   docker restart <container_name_or_id>
   ```
   - Restarts a container if it's not functioning properly.

### 7. **Check Resource Usage**
   ```bash
   docker stats
   ```
   - Displays real-time resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) of all running containers.
